Description: Ten healthy male SD rats were selected as a blank group (BG). The remaining rats received a subcutaneous injection of 2 mL DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol) solution (2.0 mg/mL) elicited a change in body temperature. Forty model rats (the rats had been injected DNP) were randomly divided into four groups (n=10/group): a model group (MG), a positive control group (aspirin, PG), a Simu-N-BHT group (RG), and another Simu-N-BHT group that received a dose three-fold higher than the RG group (3-RG). Once fever had been established (after approximately 4 h), we administered rats in the PG group with 20 mg/kg of Simu-N-BHT (intragastrically); rats in the RG group were administered with 15 mg/kg, and the 3-RG group was administered with 45 mg/kg. Rats in the BG and MG groups were given the same dose of distilled water as the RG group. 
After 5 h of fever modeling, rats in the MG group were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate. Blood samples were then collected from the abdominal aorta of each rat and removed brain tissue then dissect this tissue to obtain the hypothalamus for biochemical assays. The blood samples were transferred into aseptic tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min; serum samples were then frozen at -80°C to await analysis. The brain tissue was washed with normal saline and frozen at -80°C. Rats in the remaining experimental groups were anesthetized after 10 h; samples of blood and brain tissue were then collected in the same manner as for the MG group. Commercial ELISA kits (DECO, China) were then used to determine the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels. Biochemical assays were then used to determine the levels of PGE2, cAMP, AVP, and α-MSH in the samples of hypothalamus tissue.

Description:The dynamic dialysis method was used to determine the release characteristics of Simu-N-BHT nanoparticles in vitro. These characteristics were measured in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 1.2, 6.8, 7.4) at 37°C in a water bath (HA-140401, Harbin Donglian Electronic Technology, China). In brief, 5 mL of Simu-N-BHT nanoparticle solution was placed into a dialysis bag (MWCO: 7000 Da), immersed into 50 mL of PBS, and then dialyzed at 37°C in a water bath with stirring at 100 rpm. At different time intervals (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 21, 24, 30, 34 h), 1 mL of solution was removed and replaced with 1 mL of fresh PBS solution. The samples were then analyzed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (ACQUITY UPLC) (Waters, USA) using the following chromatographic conditions: Column: ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18-column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm); mobile phase A: water (0.1% formic acid) (Merck, USA); mobile phase B: acetonitrile (Merck, USA); elution conditions (0–1 min, 5–10%B; 1–3 min, 10–14%B; 3–5 min, 14–18%B; 5–6 min, 18%B; 6–9 min, 18–19%B; 9–12 min, 19–55%B; 12–15 min, 55–62%B); flow rate: 0.3 mL/min; detection wavelength: 256 nm; column temperature: 30°C; Sample size: 4 μL. Origin 2017 software to process and analyze data. The in vitro release data of mangiferin was model-fitted. (Zero-order dynamics, First-order kinetics, Higuchi, Ritger-Peppas, Weibull Model)

Description: Fever model rats: Each SD rat was subcutaneously injected with 5 mg DNP solution (2.5 mg/mL). Ten SD rats (in which fever had been induced) were each orally gavaged 3 mL of Simu-N-BHT solution (calculate according to the conversion formula of human and rat dosage). Blood samples were then taken from the orbit of each rat at the following time points after gavage: 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 10 h. Each blood sample was placed in tubes containing EDTA-2Na anticoagulant and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The separated upper plasma was then stored at -80°C to await analysis.For analysis, we took 100 μL of each plasma sample and added 50 μL of an internal standard solution (50 ng/mL sulfamethoxazole solution), 100 μL of standard solution, and then added 300 μL of methanol solution to remove protein. The samples were then vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 2 min, centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min, and dried at 40°C with N2. We then reconstituted the dried samples by adding 100 μL of methanol solution, vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 2 min, and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min. 
DAS 2.0 pharmacokinetic software (Mathematical Pharmacology Professional Committee of China, Shanghai) was used for data processing and the analysis of pharmacokinetic data.
